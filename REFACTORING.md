# Code Refactoring Documentation

## Overview of Changes

This project has been refactored to improve organization, maintainability, and reliability. The code has been restructured using a service-oriented approach with clear separation of concerns.

## New File Structure

```
src/
├── handler.ts                 # Main Lambda handler entry point
├── types.ts                   # Shared type definitions
└── services/
    ├── s3.service.ts          # S3 operations (upload/download)
    ├── sqs.service.ts         # SQS operations (status updates)
    └── video.service.ts       # Video processing logic
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - **S3 Service**: Handles all S3-related operations like downloading/uploading files
   - **SQS Service**: Manages all queue-related operations including FIFO queue specifics
   - **Video Service**: Contains video processing logic (extraction, archiving, etc.)

2. **FIFO Queue Handling**
   - Added proper `MessageGroupId` using the video ID to maintain order
   - Implemented deterministic deduplication IDs
   - Used the correct environment variables for queue URLs

3. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Added proper try/catch blocks throughout the codebase
   - Enhanced error logging with contextual information
   - Ensured cleanup happens even when errors occur

4. **Better Resource Management**
   - Moved AWS client initializations outside handlers for better performance
   - Added proper cleanup processes
   - Implemented async operations more efficiently

5. **Enhanced Maintainability**
   - Added meaningful function and variable names
   - Added documentation with JSDoc comments
   - Extracted magic strings to constants

## Configuration Updates

The serverless.yml file has been updated to:
- Reference the new handler function name (`handler` instead of `processVideo`)
- Include all TypeScript files in the build process

## Testing Considerations

When testing this refactored code, please verify:
1. The FIFO queue behavior (message ordering by videoId)
2. Proper status updates during the video processing lifecycle
3. Resource cleanup after processing completes or fails
